The concept of ML is depicted with an example of predicting the price of a car. The ML model
learns from data, represented as some **features** such as year, mileage, among others, and the **target** variable, in this case, the car's price, by extracting patterns from the data.

Then, the model is given new data (**without** the target) about cars and predicts their price (target).

ML is a process of **extracting patterns from data**, which is of two types:
* features (information about the object)
* target (property to predict for unseen objects)

Therefore, new feature values are presented to the model, and it makes **predictions** from the learned patterns.
