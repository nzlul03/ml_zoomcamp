The project aims to identify customers that are likely to churn or stoping to use a service. Each
customer has a score associated with the probability of churning. Considering this data, the
company would send an email with discounts or other promotions to avoid churning.

In the formula, yi is the model's prediction and belongs to {0,1}, being 0 the negative value or no churning, and 1 the positive value or churning. The output corresponds to the likelihood of
churning.

In brief, the main idea behind this project is to build a model with historical data from customers and assign a score of the likelihood of churning.
