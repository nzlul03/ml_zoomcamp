This project is about the creation of a model for helping users to predict car prices. The dataset was obtained from [this kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset).

**Project plan:**
* Prepare data and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Use linear regression for predicting price
* Understanding the internals of linear regression
* Evaluating the model with RMSE
* Feature engineering
* Regularization
* Using the model

**Pandas attributes and methods**

* `pd.read_csv(<file_path_string>)` - read csv files 
* `df.head()` - take a look of the dataframe 
* `df.columns` - retrieve colum names of a dataframe 
* `df.columns.str.lower()` - lowercase all the letters 
* `df.columns.str.replace(' ', '_')` - replace the space separator 
* `df.dtypes` - retrieve data types of all features 
* `df.index` - retrieve indices of a dataframe

## 2.3 Exploratory data analysis

[Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AlexeyGrigorev/ml-zoomcamp-2-slides)

**Pandas attributes and methods:** 

* `df[col].unique()` - returns a list of unique values in the series 
* `df[col].nunique()` - returns the number of unique values in the series 
* `df.isnull().sum()` - returns the number of null values in the dataframe 

**Matplotlib and seaborn methods:**

* `%matplotlib inline` - assure that plots are displayed in notebook's cells
* `sns.histplot()` - show the histogram of a series

**Numpy methods:**
* `np.log1p()` - applies log transformation to a variable and adds one to each result 

Long-tail distributions usually confuse the ML models, so the recommendation is to transform the target variable distribution to a normal one whenever possible.


## 2.4 Setting up the validation framework

In general, the dataset is split into three parts: training, validation, and test. For each partition, we need to obtain feature matrices (X) and y vectors of targets. First, the size of partitions is calculated, records are shuffled to guarantee that values of the three partitions contain non-sequential records of the dataset, and the partitions are created with the shuffled indices.

**Pandas attributes and methods:** 
* `df.iloc[]` - returns subsets of records of a dataframe, being selected by numerical indices
* `df.reset_index()` - restate the original indices 
* `del df[col]` - eliminates target variable 

**Numpy methods:**
* `np.arange()` - returns an array of numbers 
* `np.random.shuffle()` - returns a shuffled array
* `np.random.seed()` - set a seed 

## 2.5 Linear regression

Model for solving regression tasks, in which the objective is to adjust a line for the data and make predictions on new values. The input of this model is the **feature matrix** `X` and a `y` **vector of predictions** is obtained, trying to be as close as possible to the **actual** `y` values. The linear regression formula is the sum of the bias term \( $w_0$ \), which refers to the predictions if there is no information, and each of the feature values times their corresponding weights as \( $x_{i1} \cdot w_1 + x_{i2} \cdot w_2 + ... + x_{in} \cdot w_n$ \).

So the simple linear regression formula looks like:

$g(x_i) = w_0 + x_{i1} \cdot w_1 + x_{i2} \cdot w_2 + ... + x_{in} \cdot w_n$.

And that can be further simplified as:

$g(x_i) = w_0 + \displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j \cdot x_{ij}$

Here is a simple implementation of Linear Regression in python:

~~~~python
w0 = 7.1
def linear_regression(xi):
    
    n = len(xi)
    
    pred = w0
    w = [0.01, 0.04, 0.002]
    for j in range(n):
        pred = pred + w[j] * xi[j]
    return pred
~~~~
        

If we look at the $\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j \cdot x_{ij}$ part in the above equation, we know that this is nothing else but a vector-vector multiplication. Hence, we can rewrite the equation as $g(x_i) = w_0 + x_i^T \cdot w$

We need to assure that the result is shown on the untransformed scale by using the inverse function `exp()`. 

## 2.6 Linear regression: vector form

[Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AlexeyGrigorev/ml-zoomcamp-2-slides)

The formula of linear regression can be synthesized with the dot product between features and weights. The feature vector includes the *bias* term with an *x* value of one, such as $w_{0}^{x_{i0}},\ where\ x_{i0} = 1\ for\ w_0$.

When all the records are included, the linear regression can be calculated with the dot product between ***feature matrix*** and ***vector of weights***, obtaining the `y` vector of predictions. 

## 2.7 Training linear regression: Normal equation

[Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AlexeyGrigorev/ml-zoomcamp-2-slides)

Obtaining predictions as close as possible to $y$ target values requires the calculation of weights from the general Linear Regression equation.
The feature matrix does not 
have an inverse because it is not square, so it is required to obtain an approximate solution, which can be obtained using the **Gram matrix** (multiplication of feature matrix ($X$) and its transpose ($X^T$)). The vector of weights or coefficients $w$ obtained with this formula is the closest possible solution to the LR system.

Normal Equation:

$w$ = $(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$

Where:

$X^TX$ is the Gram Matrix
