The fourth week of Machine Learning Zoomcamp is about different metrics to evaluate a binary classifier. These measures include accuracy, confusion table, precision, recall, ROC curves(TPR, FRP, random model, and ideal model), AUROC, and cross-validation.

**Accurcy** measures the fraction of correct predictions. Specifically, it is the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions. 

We can change the **decision threshold**, it should not be always 0.5. But, in this particular problem, the best decision cutoff, associated with the hightest accuracy (80%), was indeed 0.5. 

Note that if we build a **dummy model** in which the decision cutoff is 1, so the algorithm predicts that no clients will churn, the accuracy would be 73%. Thus, we can see that the improvement of the original model with respect to the dummy model is not as high as we would expect. 

Therefore, in this problem accuracy can not tell us how good is the model because the dataset is **unbalanced**, which means that there are more instances from one category than the other. This is also known as **class imbalance**. 

**Classes and methods:** 

* `np.linspace(x,y,z)` - returns a numpy array starting at x until y with a z step 
* `Counter(x)` - collection class that counts the number of instances that satisfy the x condition
* `accuracy_score(x, y)` - sklearn.metrics class for calculating the accuracy of a model, given a predicted x dataset and a target y dataset.

### General definitions: 

* **Metric:** A single number that describes the performance of a model
* **Accuracy:** Fraction of correct answers; sometimes misleading 
* Precision and recall are less misleading when we have class inbalance
* **ROC Curve:** A way to evaluate the performance at all thresholds; okay to use with imbalance
* **K-Fold CV:** More reliable estimate for performance (mean + std)

In brief, this weeks was about different metrics to evaluate a binary classifier. These measures included accuracy, confusion table, precision, recall, ROC curves(TPR, FRP, random model, and ideal model), and AUROC. Also, we talked about a different way to estimate the performance of the model and make the parameter tuning with cross-validation.
